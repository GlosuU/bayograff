Write an autobiography, a journal or a chronology online

## TODOS

-   auth_config.json should be changed to .env variables (research)
-   Make account in Google0Auth and include keys instead of default dev keys
-   Universal Login page improvement to ask for name
-   Profile page should allow editing if not from Google
-   Update DB models to include user as author (mongoose crash course)
-   Secure export PDF

-   Images can't be inserted into Latex :(
-   After searching something, clicking Reporterms does not refresh to all reporterms
-   Allow date input with text (maybe use npm install v-calendar)
-   min and max dates should be one day off maybe (will need to use computed I believe)
