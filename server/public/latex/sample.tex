\section{My trip to Finland}
\begin{center}
\textbf{June 17, 2009 - July 20, 2009}
\end{center}
\vspace{3mm}

Finland is a really beautiful country. But the language is hard! During this summer I went there to learn Finnish. Summer is the best time to be in Finland, highly recommended!

\subsection{Visiting Helsinki}
\begin{center}
\textbf{July 16, 2009}
\end{center}
\vspace{3mm}

Helsinki has one of the world's highest urban standards of living. In 2011, the British magazine \textit{Monocle} ranked Helsinki the world's most liveable city in its liveable cities index. In the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2016 liveability survey, Helsinki was ranked ninth among 140 cities. Yes, I straight up copied this from Wikipedia.

\section{My last year at university}
\begin{center}
\textbf{September 26, 2011 - June 24, 2012}
\end{center}
\vspace{3mm}

My last year at uni was a \textbf{drag}! I really wanted to be done with it and get a \underline{real job}! I started off with chemistry blablablablabla

blablabla and by the end of the year I was super relieved to pass all my exams! What a wonderful feeling! Yay!

This meant I could now start developing websites for a living. So my life didn't really improve that much.

\subsection{My last math exam}
\begin{center}
\textbf{May 10, 2012}
\end{center}
\vspace{3mm}

I had not slept in 30 hours and I arrived late to the exam. I had forgotten my calculator at home. But luckily calculators were forbidden.

The first question was "Under certain conditions, sound travels at approximately 1080 feet per second.

If Marsala yells down a canyon and hears her echo 1.7 seconds later, approximately how deep is the canyon?"

I stared for like 10 minutes straight.

\subsection{My graduation day}
\begin{center}
\textbf{June 22, 2012}
\end{center}
\vspace{3mm}

I was really nervous this day... I still had nightmares that maybe I hadn't actually passed all exams, and those could only be cured once I held the certificate in my hands.

Yadda yadda But it all ended really well and once back home I felt a big relief and, especially, FREEDOM.

\section{The summer when I developed Bayograff}
\begin{center}
\textbf{June 1, 2020 - October 31, 2020}
\end{center}
\vspace{3mm}

This summer was no fun. We were all quarantined at home because of Covid-19.

But it was a perfect time for me to develop Bayograff.
