TITLE: My trip to Finland
PERIOD: June 17, 2009 - July 20, 2009

Finland is a really beautiful country. But the language is hard! During this summer I went there to learn Finnish. Summer is the best time to be in Finland, highly recommended!

TITLE: My last year at university
PERIOD: September 26, 2011 - June 24, 2012

My last year at uni was a drag! I really wanted to be done with it and get a real job! I started off with chemistry blablablablabla

blablabla and by the end of the year I was super relieved to pass all my exams! What a wonderful feeling! Yay!

This meant I could now start developing websites for a living. So my life didn't really improve that much.

====================

TITLE: The summer when I developed Bayograff
PERIOD: June 1, 2020 - October 31, 2020

This summer was no fun. We were all quarantined at home because of Covid-19.

But it was a perfect time for me to develop Bayograff.

TITLE: Visiting Helsinki
DATE: July 16, 2009

Helsinki has one of the world's highest urban standards of living. In 2011, the British magazine Monocle ranked Helsinki the world's most liveable city in its liveable cities index. In the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2016 liveability survey, Helsinki was ranked ninth among 140 cities. Yes, I straight up copied this from Wikipedia.

====================

TITLE: My last math exam
DATE: May 10, 2012

I had not slept in 30 hours and I arrived late to the exam. I had forgotten my calculator at home. But luckily calculators were forbidden.

The first question was "Under certain conditions, sound travels at approximately 1080 feet per second.

If Marsala yells down a canyon and hears her echo 1.7 seconds later, approximately how deep is the canyon?"

I stared for like 10 minutes straight.

====================

TITLE: My graduation day
DATE: June 22, 2012

I was really nervous this day... I still had nightmares that maybe I hadn't actually passed all exams, and those could only be cured once I held the certificate in my hands.

Yadda yadda But it all ended really well and once back home I felt a big relief and, especially, FREEDOM.
